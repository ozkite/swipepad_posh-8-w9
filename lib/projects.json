When the owner of a piece purchases climate credits, the art dynamically changes, making the artwork a visual representation of climate action. Artists benefit by being able to brand themselves with climate, extend their reach through our network, and sell more art. End users benefit by owning an appreciable piece of artwork that supports climate restoration. After our initial launch, we will create a consumer product, where our target market will be the enterprise. We will empower enterprises to offer carbon offsetting as an employee benefit and showcase this culture to the public in a verifiable way. OUR KEY DIFFERENTIATORS - Using Art - We believe that art has the unique ability to inspire and emotionally engage people. Our product integrates the artwork from established artists. Nicole Buffett (top 50 NFT influencers), Carlos James (his art was on the August 2022 Time Magazine cover), and other top-end artists are working with us. - Blockchain Based Climate Credits - Blockchain based climate credits introduce transparency and verifiability since each credit is stamped with meta-data about the project (location, relevant images, auditor, etc.), thereby cultivating greater trust in the authenticity of the climate project - Incentivization - After the initial rollout, we will allow users to earn tokens that can be redeemed for brand rewards or traded for cash. Essentially, this creates a \"frequent flyer program\" for climate action that encourages more people to participate - High Quality Climate Credits - Phil Taylor, a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur is on our team and helping us select high quality carbon credits that are nature based, offer clear additionality, and have secondary benefits wrt biodiversity, land health, soil health. etc.",

Our research continues. Lessons learned from the first field test of our design patterns, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our tools continue to evolve.",

The tokens would represent a waste reduction credit that can be then sold in exchanges. The tokens provide a disruptive tokenization of carbon credits, particularly in relation to scope 3.

We want to create a more expressive language to describe our economic networks, their participants, the nature of their relations and how they change, what they value, how it is measured and exchanged. An ECONOMIC GRAMMAR which open and free to use, gives everyone equal capacities of economic expression and does not collapse into single universal value definition of a fiat money or a \u201cmaster token\u201d (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.).\nSocial media horizontalized our communication, but left the information and protocol layer called the economy untouched. We can\u2019t control the economic protocols that underpin the value capture of our communication. The next generation media will redesign the default convergence of communication, finance and computation, and fuse messaging and economy in ways that are programmable from below.\nThese two projects, the redesign of communications and the redesign of money are actually one.

    "Description of Project": "Our solution is divided in 2: 1. My co founder and I are building a B2B e procurement platform to help corporations meet their sustainability goals by offering them a variety of triple impact products and guidance, so they can switch from a traditional purchasing system to a more sustainable office supplies purchasing system, and slowly start diminishing their carbon footprint 2. a>>Given the fact that in Argentina we need to register every commercial transaction via a CAE code and a QR which is stored in the government data base, we want to leverage this and write a smart contract to store our most significant commercial transactions with corporations, as a non fungible token. Current local system only allows you to access just your own commercial transactions, this will open the game to more eyes. b>>The NFT will have art work added, so they can also be sold to fund\/collaborate with the manufacturing workshops that produce sustainable items in Argentina, mainly integrated by low income, not formally trained\/educated people, people with disabilities, women and minorities that have no chances to join the work force. Or with Non Profit Org, TBD. This means we also need to build a transparent way to redirect the revenue from the NFT sell, to these manufacturing places\/NPO. Which we think could be a great opportunity to collaborate with local custodial wallets and also a way to onboard more people to the crypto world. We think there will be an incentive to buy these NFTs because, who doesn't want to help the world in such an easy way as well as brag about it by showing their triple impact NFT (triple impact because it has social impact and it is based on a sustainable purchase). 3.We want to build a Metaverse Sustainable NFT's HOUSE with different rooms for eahc of our corporate customers, hoping to use Open Metaverse spaces, so our customers and all the NFT's owners, will have the platform\/space to show the NFTs they are related to, which store a sustainable transactions and the manufacturers\/NPO who received the funding, to the world.",

We give people the instagram life they want now, while baking in more that the masses (if we are honest) don't really give AF about.
