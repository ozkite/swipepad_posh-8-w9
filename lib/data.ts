      'Avatree\'s mission is to use art to amplify climate action. We work with established artists by connecting their art to climate restoration efforts via the blockchain. When the owner of a piece purchases climate credits, the art dynamically changes, making the artwork a visual representation of climate action. Artists benefit by being able to brand themselves with climate, extend their reach through our network, and sell more art. End users benefit by owning an appreciable piece of artwork that supports climate restoration. After our initial launch, we will create a consumer product, where our target market will be the enterprise. We will empower enterprises to offer carbon offsetting as an employee benefit and showcase this culture to the public in a verifiable way. OUR KEY DIFFERENTIATORS - Using Art - We believe that art has the unique ability to inspire and emotionally engage people. Our product integrates the artwork from established artists. Nicole Buffett (top 50 NFT influencers), Carlos James (his art was on the August 2022 Time Magazine cover), and other top-end artists are working with us. - Blockchain Based Climate Credits - Blockchain based climate credits introduce transparency and verifiability since each credit is stamped with meta-data about the project (location, relevant images, auditor, etc.), thereby cultivating greater trust in the authenticity of the climate project - Incentivization - After the initial rollout, we will allow users to earn tokens that can be redeemed for brand rewards or traded for cash. Essentially, this creates a "frequent flyer program" for climate action that encourages more people to participate - High Quality Climate Credits - Phil Taylor, a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur is on our team and helping us select high quality carbon credits that are nature based, offer clear additionality, and have secondary benefits wrt biodiversity, land health, soil health. etc.',
